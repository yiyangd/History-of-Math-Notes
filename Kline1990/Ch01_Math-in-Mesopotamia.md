# Chapter 01. Mathematics in Mesopotamia (Page 3 - 14)

> Logic can be patient for it is eternal. - Oliver Heaviside

### 1. Where did Mathematics Begin? (Page 3)
| **Mathematics in Early Civilizations** | **早期文明中的数学** |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Mathematics as an organized, independent, and reasoned discipline did not exist before the classical Greeks of the period from 600 to 300 B.C. entered upon the scene. | 在公元前600至300年的古希腊人出现之前，数学并不算是一个有组织的、独立的、有理性的学科。 |
| There were, however, prior civilizations in which the beginnings or rudiments of mathematics were created. | 然而，在更早的文明中，数学的起源或基本雏形已经被创造出来。 |

#### 1.1. Mathematics begins with Counting Numbers (Arithmetic 算术)
| Many of these primitive civilizations did not get beyond **distinguishing among one, two, and many**; others possessed, and were able to operate with, large whole numbers. | 这些原始文明中的许多文明仅仅能**区分一、二和多**，而一些文明可以掌握并能够操作较大的整数。 |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Still others achieved the recognition of numbers as abstract concepts, the adoption of special words for the individual numbers, the introduction of symbols for numbers, and even the use of a base such as ten, twenty, or five to denote a larger unit of quantity. | 还有一些文明认识到数字作为抽象概念，采用了特定的词语来表示单个数字，引入了数字的符号，甚至使用十、二十或五作为基数来表示更大的数量单位。 |
| One also finds the four operations of arithmetic, but confined to small numbers, and the concept of a fraction, limited, however, to 1/2, 1/3, and the like, and expressed in words. | 人们还发现了四则运算，但仅限于小数字，以及分数的概念，但只限于1/2、1/3等，并用词语来表达。 |

#### 1.2. Mathematics begins with Observing and Measuring the World (Geometry 几何图形)
| In addition, the simplest geometric notions, line, circle, and angle, were recognized. | 此外，最简单的几何概念，如线、圆和角，也被认识到。 |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| It is perhaps of interest that the concept of angle must have arisen from observation of the angle formed by man’s thigh and lower leg or his forearm and upper arm because in most languages the word for the side of an angle is either the word for leg or the word for arm. | 有趣的是，角的概念可能源于对人类大腿和小腿或前臂和上臂所形成角度的观察，因为在大多数语言中，角的一边的词语要么是腿的词，要么是手臂的词。 |
| In English, for example, we speak of the arms of a right triangle. | 例如，在英语中，我们称直角三角形的边为"arms"。 |
| The uses of mathematics in these primitive civilizations were limited to simple trading, the crude calculation of areas of fields, geometric decoration on pottery, patterns woven into cloth, and the recording of time. | 在这些原始文明中，数学的用途仅限于简单的贸易、粗略的田地面积计算、陶器上的几何装饰、织物中的图案编织和时间的记录。 |

**Summary:**  
**This paragraph discusses the early stages of mathematical development in ancient civilizations, highlighting their understanding of numbers, basic arithmetic, geometry, and their practical applications.**  
**本段讨论了古代文明中数学发展的早期阶段，强调了它们对数字、基本算术、几何及其实际应用的理解。**

#### 1.3. Mathematics begins around 3000 B.C. 

Here is the continuation based on the provided paragraph:

| **The Slow Development of Early Mathematics** | **早期数学的缓慢发展** |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Until we reach the mathematics of the Babylonians and the Egyptians of about 3000 B.C., we do not find more advanced steps in mathematics. | 直到我们接触到大约公元前3000年的巴比伦人和埃及人的数学时，才发现数学的进一步发展。 |
| Since primitive peoples settled down in one area, built homes, and relied upon agriculture and animal husbandry as far back as 10,000 B.C., we see how slowly the most elementary mathematics made its first steps. | 自从原始人类定居于一地、建造家园并依赖农业和畜牧业早至公元前10,000年时，我们看到最基本的数学是如何缓慢地迈出第一步的。 |
| Moreover, the existence of vast numbers of civilizations with no mathematics to speak of shows how sparsely this science was cultivated. | 此外，大量没有数学记录的文明的存在表明这种科学的传播是多么的稀疏。 |

**Summary:**  
**This paragraph highlights the slow progression of mathematics in early civilizations, emphasizing the gradual development until the era of the Babylonians and Egyptians and the widespread lack of mathematical knowledge in many other societies.**  
**本段强调了早期文明中数学的缓慢发展，直到巴比伦人和埃及人时代才有所进展，并指出许多其他社会缺乏数学知识的普遍现象。**

### 2. Political History in Mesopotamia (Page 4)
Here is the translation based on the provided paragraph:

| **The Babylonians and the Advancement of Mathematics** | **巴比伦人与数学的进步** |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| The Babylonians were the first of these two early civilizations to contribute to the main course of mathematics. | 巴比伦人是这两个早期文明中第一个为数学的主要进程做出贡献的。 |
| Since our knowledge of the ancient civilizations of the Near East and of Babylonia in particular is largely the product of archaeological research of the last hundred years, this knowledge is incomplete and subject to correction as new discoveries are made. | 由于我们对近东古代文明，尤其是巴比伦的了解，主要来自于过去一百年的考古研究，因此这些知识并不完整，并会随着新发现的出现而修正。|
| The term "Babylonian" covers a series of peoples, who concurrently or successively occupied the area around and between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, a region known as Mesopotamia and now part of modern Iraq. | "巴比伦人"一词涵盖了一系列民族，他们同时或相继占据了底格里斯河和幼发拉底河之间及其周围的地区，这个地区被称为美索不达米亚，现在是现代伊拉克的一部分。 |
| These peoples lived in independent cities such as Babylon, Ur, Nippur, Susa, Aššur, Uruk, Lagash, Kish, and others. | 这些民族生活在独立的城市中，如巴比伦、乌尔、尼普尔、苏萨、亚述、乌鲁克、拉加什、基什等。 |
| About 4000 B.C., the Sumerians, racially distinct from the Semitic and Indo-Germanic peoples, settled down in part of Mesopotamia. | 大约公元前4000年，苏美尔人，这些种族上与闪族和印欧-日耳曼民族不同的人，在美索不达米亚的一部分定居下来。 |
| Their capital city was Ur, and the land area they controlled was called Sumer. | 他们的首都是乌尔，他们控制的地区被称为苏美尔。 |
| Though their culture reached its height about 2250 B.C., even before this, about 2500 B.C., the Sumerians came under the political control of the Akkadians, a Semitic people whose major city was Akkad and who were led at that time by the ruler Sargon. | 虽然他们的文化在公元前2250年左右达到了顶峰，但在此之前的公元前2500年左右，苏美尔人被阿卡德人的政治控制，阿卡德人是一个闪族民族，其主要城市是阿卡德，当时由统治者萨尔贡领导。 |
| Sumerian civilization was submerged in the Akkadian. | 苏美尔文明被阿卡德文明所吞没。 |
| A period of high culture occurred during the reign of King Hammurabi (about 1700 B.C.), who is known as the formulator of a famous code of law. | 在国王汉谟拉比（约公元前1700年）统治期间，出现了一个高文化的时期，他因制定了著名的法典而闻名。 |

**Summary:**  
**This paragraph discusses the Babylonians' contribution to mathematics, the archaeological understanding of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, and the historical context of the Sumerians and Akkadians.**  
**本段讨论了巴比伦人在数学上的贡献，对古代美索不达米亚文明的考古理解，以及苏美尔人和阿卡德人的历史背景。**

| **The Influence of Political Changes on Mesopotamian Mathematics** | **政治变革对美索不达米亚数学的影响** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Around 1000 B.C., migrations and the introduction of iron resulted in further changes. | 大约在公元前1000年，迁徙和铁器的引入带来了进一步的变化。 |
| Later, in the eighth century B.C., the area was ruled by the Assyrians, who settled primarily in the upper Tigris region. | 后来，在公元前八世纪，该地区由亚述人统治，他们主要定居在底格里斯河上游地区。 |
| To our knowledge, they did not add anything new to the culture. | 据我们所知，他们并未对文化添加任何新内容。 |
| A century later, the Assyrian empire was shared by the Chaldeans and the Medes, the latter being close racially to the Persians further east. | 一世纪后，亚述帝国被迦勒底人和米底人瓜分，后者在种族上与更东边的波斯人相近。 |
| This period in Mesopotamian history (7th cent. B.C.) is often referred to as Chaldean. | 美索不达米亚历史上的这一时期（公元前7世纪）通常被称为迦勒底时期。 |
| The Near East was conquered by the Persians under Cyrus about 540 B.C. | 大约在公元前540年，波斯人在居鲁士的领导下征服了近东地区。 |
| Persian mathematicians such as Nabu-rimanni (c. 490 B.C.) and Kidinu (c. 480 B.C.) became known to the Greeks. | 波斯数学家如纳布-里曼尼（约公元前490年）和基丁奴（约公元前480年）为希腊人所知。 |
| In 330 B.C., Alexander the Great, the Greek military leader, conquered Mesopotamia. | 公元前330年，希腊军事领袖亚历山大大帝征服了美索不达米亚。 |
| The period from 300 B.C. to the birth of Christ is called Seleucid after the Greek general who first took control of the region following the death of Alexander in 323 B.C. | 从公元前300年到基督诞生的时期被称为塞琉古时期，得名于亚历山大逝世后首先控制该地区的希腊将军。 |
| However, the flowering of Greek mathematics had already taken place, and from the time of Alexander until the seventh century A.D., when the Arabs arrived on the scene, the Greek influence predominated in the Near East. | 然而，希腊数学的繁荣已经开始，并且从亚历山大时期一直到公元7世纪阿拉伯人到来之前，希腊的影响在近东地区占据主导地位。 |
| Most of what the Babylonians contributed to mathematics predates the Seleucid period. | 巴比伦人在数学上的大部分贡献都早于塞琉古时期。 |
| Despite the numerous changes in the rulers of Mesopotamia, there was, in mathematics, a continuity of knowledge, tradition, and practice from ancient times at least to the time of Alexander. | 尽管美索不达米亚的统治者经历了多次更迭，但在数学领域，从古代到至少亚历山大时期，知识、传统和实践都保持了连续性。 |

**Summary:**  
**This paragraph outlines the impact of political changes on Mesopotamian mathematics, highlighting the various ruling powers and the continuity of mathematical knowledge from ancient times through the Seleucid period.**  
**本段概述了政治变革对美索不达米亚数学的影响，重点介绍了各个统治势力以及从古代到塞琉古时期数学知识的连续性。**
