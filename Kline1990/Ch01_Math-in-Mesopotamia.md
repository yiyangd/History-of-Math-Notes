### 1. Where did Mathematics Begin? (Page 3)
| **Mathematics in Early Civilizations** | **早期文明中的数学** |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Mathematics as an organized, independent, and reasoned discipline did not exist before the classical Greeks of the period from 600 to 300 B.C. entered upon the scene. | 在公元前600至300年的古希腊人出现之前，数学并不算是一个有组织的、独立的、有理性的学科。 |
| There were, however, prior civilizations in which the beginnings or rudiments of mathematics were created. | 然而，在更早的文明中，数学的起源或基本雏形已经被创造出来。 |

#### 1.1. Mathematics begins with Counting Numbers (Arithmetic 算术)
| Many of these primitive civilizations did not get beyond **distinguishing among one, two, and many**; others possessed, and were able to operate with, large whole numbers. | 这些原始文明中的许多文明仅仅能**区分一、二和多**，而一些文明可以掌握并能够操作较大的整数。 |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Still others achieved the recognition of numbers as abstract concepts, the adoption of special words for the individual numbers, the introduction of symbols for numbers, and even the use of a base such as ten, twenty, or five to denote a larger unit of quantity. | 还有一些文明认识到数字作为抽象概念，采用了特定的词语来表示单个数字，引入了数字的符号，甚至使用十、二十或五作为基数来表示更大的数量单位。 |
| One also finds the four operations of arithmetic, but confined to small numbers, and the concept of a fraction, limited, however, to 1/2, 1/3, and the like, and expressed in words. | 人们还发现了四则运算，但仅限于小数字，以及分数的概念，但只限于1/2、1/3等，并用词语来表达。 |

#### 1.2. Mathematics begins with Observing and Measuring the World (Geometry 几何图形)
| In addition, the simplest geometric notions, line, circle, and angle, were recognized. | 此外，最简单的几何概念，如线、圆和角，也被认识到。 |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| It is perhaps of interest that the concept of angle must have arisen from observation of the angle formed by man’s thigh and lower leg or his forearm and upper arm because in most languages the word for the side of an angle is either the word for leg or the word for arm. | 有趣的是，角的概念可能源于对人类大腿和小腿或前臂和上臂所形成角度的观察，因为在大多数语言中，角的一边的词语要么是腿的词，要么是手臂的词。 |
| In English, for example, we speak of the arms of a right triangle. | 例如，在英语中，我们称直角三角形的边为"arms"。 |
| The uses of mathematics in these primitive civilizations were limited to simple trading, the crude calculation of areas of fields, geometric decoration on pottery, patterns woven into cloth, and the recording of time. | 在这些原始文明中，数学的用途仅限于简单的贸易、粗略的田地面积计算、陶器上的几何装饰、织物中的图案编织和时间的记录。 |

**Summary:**  
**This paragraph discusses the early stages of mathematical development in ancient civilizations, highlighting their understanding of numbers, basic arithmetic, geometry, and their practical applications.**  
**本段讨论了古代文明中数学发展的早期阶段，强调了它们对数字、基本算术、几何及其实际应用的理解。**

#### 1.3. Mathematics begins around 3000 B.C. 

Here is the continuation based on the provided paragraph:

| **The Slow Development of Early Mathematics** | **早期数学的缓慢发展** |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Until we reach the mathematics of the Babylonians and the Egyptians of about 3000 B.C., we do not find more advanced steps in mathematics. | 直到我们接触到大约公元前3000年的巴比伦人和埃及人的数学时，才发现数学的进一步发展。 |
| Since primitive peoples settled down in one area, built homes, and relied upon agriculture and animal husbandry as far back as 10,000 B.C., we see how slowly the most elementary mathematics made its first steps. | 自从原始人类定居于一地、建造家园并依赖农业和畜牧业早至公元前10,000年时，我们看到最基本的数学是如何缓慢地迈出第一步的。 |
| Moreover, the existence of vast numbers of civilizations with no mathematics to speak of shows how sparsely this science was cultivated. | 此外，大量没有数学记录的文明的存在表明这种科学的传播是多么的稀疏。 |

**Summary:**  
**This paragraph highlights the slow progression of mathematics in early civilizations, emphasizing the gradual development until the era of the Babylonians and Egyptians and the widespread lack of mathematical knowledge in many other societies.**  
**本段强调了早期文明中数学的缓慢发展，直到巴比伦人和埃及人时代才有所进展，并指出许多其他社会缺乏数学知识的普遍现象。**
